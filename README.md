I employed the require method to implement the icons and images
I used different styles like padding, margin and so on.
I used the following components ;
StyleSheet: Defines and manages styles for components in a structured manner.

Text: Displays text content.

View: Acts as a container for organizing other components.

Image: Renders images from local or remote sources.

TextInput: Allows user input via a text field.

FlatList: Efficiently renders and handles large lists of data.
